%--------------------PAGE-LAYOUT-SETTINGS-----------------------

% Setting the page layout using the "geometry" package.

% Summary page layout consistent with that of the thesis
%\geometry{
%	a4paper,
%	ignoremp,
%	bindingoffset = 1cm, 
%	textwidth     = 13.5cm,
%	textheight    = 21.5cm,
%	lmargin       = 3.5cm,
%	tmargin       = 4cm   
%}

% Summary page layout inconsistent with that of the thesis v1: no "bindingoffset", "rmargin" equal to "lmargin", reduced "tmargin" and "bmargin".
%\geometry{
%	a4paper,
%	ignoremp,
%	bindingoffset = 0cm, 
%	textwidth     = 13.5cm,
%	textheight    = 21.5cm,
%	lmargin       = 3.5cm,
%	rmargin       = 3.5cm,
%	tmargin       = 0.5cm,
%	bmargin       = 1.8cm  
%}

% Summary page layout inconsistent with that of the thesis v2: no "bindingoffset", "rmargin" equal to "lmargin" and both reduced, reduced "tmargin" and "bmargin".
\geometry{
	a4paper,
	ignoremp,
	bindingoffset = 0cm, 
	textwidth     = 13.5cm,
	textheight    = 21.5cm,
	lmargin       = 3.0cm,
	rmargin       = 3.0cm,
	tmargin       = 0.5cm,
	bmargin       = 2.0cm  
}

% The page layout in the "geometry" package contains a total body (printable area) and margins: the total body consists of a body (text area) with an optional header, footer and marginal notes; the margins are left, right, top and bottom (for twosided documents, horizontal margins should be called inner and outer).

% The "a4paper" specifies the paper size by name.

% The "ignoremp" option disregards the marginal notes in determining the horizontal margins (defaults to true).

% The "bindingoffset" option removes a specified space from the lefthand-side of the page for oneside printing or the inner-side for twoside printing. This is useful if pages are bound by a press binding.

% The "textwidth" option the width of the body.

% The "textheight" option sets the height of the body (including footnotes and figures, excluding running head and foot).

% The "lmargin" option sets the left margin (for oneside printing) or inner margin (for twoside printing) of total body: the distance between the left or inner edge of the paper and that of total body.

% The "rmargin" option sets the right margin (for oneside printing) or outer margin (for twoside printing) of total body: the distance between the right or outer edge of the paper and that of total body.

% The "tmargin" option sets the top margin of the page.

% The "bmargin" option sets the bottom margin of the page.
