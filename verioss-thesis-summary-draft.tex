\frenchspacing
% This causes LaTeX to make spacing after all punctuation, including periods, be the same as the space between words in the middle of a sentence. Using "\nonfrenchspacing" switches back to the default handling in which spacing after most punctuation stretches or shrinks differently than a word space. If your LaTeX document specifies the language being used, for example with the babel package, the necessary settings should be taken care of for you.

\raggedbottom
% Make all later pages the natural height of the material on that page; no rubber vertical lengths will be stretched. Thus, in a two-sided document the facing pages may be different heights. If however you want "\flushbottom" then you have to ensure that the page content fits in the specified size. For example if your content consists entirely of lines of text on a 15 pt baseline with no stretchy white space between lines or paragraphs, and your text body height is not a multiple of that \baselineskip, then every page will be underfull as TeX cannot achieve the specified size so has to break a line short.

\pagestyle{empty}
% Declaration that specifies how the page headers and footers are typeset, from the current page onwards. With the "plain" style the header is empty and the footer contains only a page number, centered. With the "empty" style the header and footer are both empty. With the "headings" style put running headers and footers on each page and the document style specifies what goes in there. With the "myheadings" style custom headers, specified via the "\markboth" or the "\markright" commands, will be used.
